================git 
---advantage

1.Distributed model: This means your work is your own.
 You can let otherls see only what is necessary. Not everything has to be public. 
2.Branching and merging are easy: Branching is a walk in the park. 
It feels like a natural part of the workflow. 
They are cheap (fast and consume very little space) so that you can branch whenever you want. 
3.Workflow is flexible: Compared to Centralized VCS, git has the qualities that allow to choose your own workflow. 
It can be as simple as a centralised workflow to as hierarchical as the dictator-lieutenant workflow. 
4.Data integrity is assured: Because git uses SHA1 trees,
 data corruption due to external reasons can be easily detected.
5.Icing on the cake:
-Fast
-Staging
-Free
----Disadvantage
1.Steep learning curve: Many commands with many options, some commands are non-intuitive 
and need a level of understanding the internals of git, commands and arguments are inconsistent
 to some degree
2.Binary files are a big no: If your project has non-text files that are updated frequently 
(images for websites or MS Office documents), then git becomes bloated and slow.

=============composer

Composer is a dependency manager for PHP (similar to Bundler for Ruby apps). 
Composer allows developers to specify project dependencies in a composer. ... 
Composer makes it easier to keep vendor libraries out of your repo, meaning 
that only application code goes in the git repository
===========What is composer

Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. Composer will allow you to manage your libraries,
 classes, and functions throughout your applications.
 These libraries and classes that you create for Composer are referred to as Packages.

===composer command

$ composer install
This command reads the content of the composer.json from the current folder 
and installs the selected dependencies into vendor folder.

If composer.lock exists in the current directory, the specific version will 
be used instead of those selected by Composer. It assures that there’s a compatibility between the downloaded and used packages.

If composer.lock doesn’t exist in the current directory, it will be created after the bundles’ installation.

$ composer dump-autoload
loDump-autoload allows to refresh the content of autoload.php and to generate new autoload entries.

$ composer self-update
Used to update Composer version.

$ composer update 
This command matches all dependencies and saves the specific versions to composer.lock.

$ composer update vendor/package vendor/package2
This command updates selected packages if stable updates of these bundles are available.

$ composer show
absolvent/phpunit-symfony
acid/symfony
admafa/proyecto-final-symfony
...
It displays the list of available bundles in the library.

$ composer show vendor/package
$ composer show vendor/package 1.0.2
Returns the details of the bundle or of its particular version.

$ composer show -i
alexandresalome/php-selenium     1.0.1      PHP Library for Selenium
behat/behat                      v2.5.0     Scenario-oriented BDD framework for ...
behat/common-contexts            v1.2.0     Commonly used contexts for Behat
...
Shows installed bundles and their versions.

$ composer show -s
...
requires
php >=5.4.0
symfony/symfony 2.3.*
symfony/assetic-bundle 2.3.*
symfony/swiftmailer-bundle 2.3.*
symfony/monolog-bundle 2.3.*
...
Command use to see how Composer interprets composer.json file.
